	UX

Chat
- Create thread
- Exchange 10 messages and edit document
- Decide that you've developed a useful idea
- Click "Promote to Node" -> option to promote to new node, or add to an existing one?
- System summarizes the chat conversation
	- Biased towards more recent messages. This is ok because it's more likely that 1) the user has honed in on the idea in more recent chats and 2) if small details / trains of thought earlier in the convo are important... just branch into another thread, and then convert *that* into a node too.

Node viewer
- Browse nodes and view details

Thread context
- When creating a new thread, "add node to context"




- Differentiate between core threads and scratch threads? Do we want all threads/convos to be able to modify existing nodes, or only ones that are "core" trains of thought? What if we branch into a thread just to explore an idea, but then abandon it?
