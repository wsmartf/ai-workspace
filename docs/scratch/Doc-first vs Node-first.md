You're asking exactly the right question — and you're now *designing the interface between human and AI thought*.

Let’s step back and look at the two possible models you're describing:

---

## 🧭 Two Modes of Interaction

### **1. Document-First Mode**  
> “I’m writing a document. Help me flesh it out, structure it, edit it, and reason about it.”

- User writes and revises main documents
- LLM helps edit, clean, restructure, brainstorm
- Nodes are built *from* these docs + related threads
- Memory = support system for doc production

✅ Feels familiar (like Notion, Docs, Obsidian)  
✅ Useful for product specs, essays, design docs, etc.  
🔁 Feedback loop: Thread → Node → Doc → New ideas

---

### **2. Node-First Mode**  
> “I’m exploring and developing a web of ideas. Help me think clearly, organize insights, and map connections.”

- User interacts mostly through threads, idea branches, Q&A
- AI continuously updates/refines knowledge nodes
- Occasional docs emerge as **synthesis artifacts** from the graph
- Nodes feel like atomic, living thoughts

✅ Feels more like Roam Research + a thinking partner  
✅ Great for early-stage ideation, strategy, research  
✅ Eventually, you can say “Turn these 5 nodes into a first draft doc”

---

## 🧠 The Key Realization: You Don’t Have to Pick

The magic is in **combining** these:

> **Nodes** are for **ongoing idea evolution.**  
> **Docs** are for **externalizing, refining, shipping.**

Let’s say you’re building a product:
- You explore 5 ideas via threads
- Those get promoted into nodes
- Those nodes link to each other, evolve
- After a while, you say:
  > “Turn all of this into a spec for `Feature X`”
- Agent pulls relevant nodes → synthesizes draft → saves to `docs/specs/feature-x.md`

💡 You *could* keep refining that doc directly — and the system can **diff it**, extract new info, and update relevant nodes.

Or you stay in the node-space, iterating.

---

## 🧰 So: How Should You Build the System?

Here’s the opinionated recommendation:

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Node-First *with* Manual Docs
- Let users chat, explore, promote to nodes
- Let users also maintain docs (manually + with GPT help)
- Nodes are editable + linkable
- Add a simple UI to generate new docs from selected nodes

> “I’ve selected 3 nodes about onboarding. Generate a draft doc.”
>
> “This doc is out of sync with recent nodes — want to update it?”

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Doc-Aware Node Evolution
- GPT diffs doc edits → updates/splits nodes as needed
- Agent suggests: “This change to `main.md` conflicts with memory in `goals-node.md` — resolve?”

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Full AI-Augmented Thinking
- Agent can operate entirely on nodes
- Suggests “idea drift”, merges, forks
- You can say: “Explore tradeoffs of these 3 nodes” → it starts a new thread, creates new nodes
- Docs become **publishable views**, not the only surface of work

---

## 🔄 Analogy: Figma vs Design System

- **Docs** are like final Figma mockups
- **Nodes** are like reusable components, idea atoms, comment threads, iterations
- You might have:
  - `project/specs/`
  - `project/nodes/`
  - `project/scratch/`

---

## ✅ What to Build Next

You’ve already started building threads, documents, memory…

The next feature to glue this together:

### → **“Promote to Node” flow**
- Appears at the end of a thread
- Lets you generate + edit a `KnowledgeNode`
- Stores it to `nodes/` or `memory/`
- Adds links to thread ID, doc IDs
- Let users later select nodes to generate a doc

✅ Now you’ve connected all the layers.
