Here’s a high-level blueprint of the **post-MVP vision** for the Knowledge Node system — broken into **Stage 2 (Structured Intelligence)** and **Stage 3 (Self-Evolving Thought Engine)**.

This maps out *where it’s going*, assuming you're building a system that:

- Organizes your ideas as you work  
- Evolves its own internal model of what matters  
- Builds working context from a persistent semantic graph  
- Lets you write less and think better

---

# 🔭 Stage 2: Structured Intelligence

> The system builds and navigates a rich, interconnected knowledge graph — helping you think, recall, and write more effectively.

---

### Core Additions

#### 1. **Vector Search Over Nodes**
- Nodes and documents are embedded (e.g. OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or `bge-small`)
- Local vector store (Chroma, Qdrant) powers fast similarity search
- Used to:
  - Find related nodes while chatting
  - Auto-suggest connections between nodes
  - Build LLM context on-demand (RAG-style)

---

#### 2. **Auto-Linking + Context Bundles**
- When a node is created or updated:
  - LLM suggests links to other nodes
  - Adds references to `related` field
- "Context bundle" = small set of linked nodes that can be retrieved together

Used for:
- Auto-context in chat
- Document suggestions
- Summary views

---

#### 3. **Enhanced Node Viewer**
- Tag filters
- Search (full text + vector similarity)
- Timeline mode: show recent updates
- Node backlinks (who references this?)

---

#### 4. **Visual Graph View**
- Force-directed graph UI
- View clusters of ideas, link density
- Click to open threads or docs from nodes
- Useful for brainstorming, navigation, and summarization

---

#### 5. **Thread ↔ Node Integration**
- Start thread from node
- End thread → updates node automatically
- System suggests: “This discussion changed 2 related nodes — want to update?”

---

#### 6. **Doc–Node Sync Engine**
- On doc change:
  - LLM checks which nodes are affected
  - Proposes updates to node summaries
  - You can approve or batch-edit

---

### Supporting Tech
- Embedding store: Chroma or Qdrant
- Vector search: cosine similarity
- Graph: JSON + metadata or something like MemGraph/Neo4j
- UI: React + D3 or Cytoscape.js for visual graph
- Background job runner: node/py task queue for async diffing, indexing

---

# 🧠 Stage 3: Self-Evolving Thought Engine

> The system becomes your long-term creative memory. It self-organizes, compresses, and reasons across knowledge — like a thinking partner.

---

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Autonomous Node Maintenance**
- Every few hours:
  - Clusters similar nodes
  - Merges low-value duplicates
  - Prunes obsolete knowledge (soft delete)
  - Generates update proposals:
    - “Split this node?”
    - “Update summary based on recent thread X?”

- Runs in background while you work

---

#### 2. **Semantic Thread Mapping**
- Threads are no longer linear history — they’re mapped onto nodes
- Each message optionally links to:
  - Active node
  - Knowledge artifact
  - “Divergence point” (start of a new branch)

Used for:
- Navigation
- Regenerating context
- Summarizing entire lines of inquiry

---

#### 3. **Agent-Powered Thinking Tasks**
- Use multi-step LLM agents (via crewAI, AutoGPT-style tools) to:
  - Deeply reflect on a node cluster
  - Write longform content
  - Propose architectural restructures

Example:
> “Build a draft report from all nodes tagged `research + ux`, and prune redundant ones.”

---

#### 4. **Intent-Aware Context Building**
- Model recognizes *why* you’re asking something
- Builds prompt context accordingly:
  - Nodes
  - Document snippets
  - Past threads
  - Related dead ends or tradeoffs

This enables:
- Near-instant responses with rich grounding
- Highly relevant and minimal context windows

---

#### 5. **Memory State Profiles**
- Different memory states for different projects, goals, modes
- Ability to switch:
  - “Deep Work Mode”
  - “Pitch Deck View”
  - “Technical Architecture”

Each profile prioritizes certain nodes + context behaviors

---

#### 6. **Long-Term Memory Compression**
- LLM generates “distilled memory” summaries from large node clusters
- Periodic roll-ups:
  - “Here’s what you’ve learned in the last 2 weeks”
  - “Here’s the current position on `pricing strategy`”

Stored as super-nodes, and referenced instead of dozens of smaller ones

---

#### 7. **Goal-Oriented Node Trees**
- Define high-level objectives
- Nodes auto-tagged with relevance score
- System builds evolving *strategy tree* under each goal

e.g.

```
Goal: Build v2 knowledge engine
├── Design: visual UI, metadata model
├── Retrieval: RAG, vector, re-ranking
├── Agent: auto-updater, idea generator
```

---

### Supporting Tech
- Background workers: Python or Bun + queue (async reflection, maintenance)
- Agent execution: CrewAI, LangGraph, LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Node storage: JSON or structured Markdown + Graph DB hybrid
- Embedding updates: lazy / on-change
- Fast context builders: filtered + cached bundles

---

## Summary

| Feature Tier | Focus |
|--------------|-------|
| **Stage 1 (MVP)** | Manual threads → nodes → docs |
| **Stage 2** | Interconnected graph + RAG search + doc sync |
| **Stage 3** | Self-evolving memory + agent reasoning + long-term structure |

---

Once we align on this, we can map your MVP choices against future needs (e.g. store things now in a way that supports later linking, embeddings, and graph structure).

Want to start by locking down the exact MVP node format and flows so it's forward-compatible with this vision?
