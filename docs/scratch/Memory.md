# 🧠 Part 1: What You’re Trying to Solve
You’re grappling with:

### 1. **Linear Chat Limitations**
- Ideas get buried in past messages
- You lose threads of reasoning
- You want ideas to **persist in structured, editable, and explorable form**

### 2. **Knowledge Evolution**
- You want the KB to **self-organize, split, merge, and evolve**
- You don’t want to micromanage memory
- You want it to **feel effortless**, like it grows in the background

### 3. **Efficient Context Construction**
- You don’t want to query the model for *everything*
- You want to **build context locally** (graph traversal, indexing)
- You want context to be *shaped*, not dumped

---

# 📐 Part 2: Structuring the Solution

Here’s how we can organize your emerging concepts.

---

## 🔹 1. **From Threads → Knowledge Nodes**
### Idea:
> Every thread (or branch) builds toward a **Node** in a growing graph/tree of ideas.

- Each Node is a **living summary** of an evolving topic.
- Ending a thread “promotes” the conversation into a node.
- These nodes are editable, referenceable, and linked.
- Dead-ends are stored with tags like `"superseded"` or `"invalid"`.

You can treat threads like **idea incubators**. When you say, “Yeah, this is good,” you *promote* it to the KB.

> _"End of thread → Create Node → Suggest document updates → Archive thread"_  
> _"Dead end? Tag it as such — useful context for what not to repeat."_

---

## 🔹 2. **Evolving Structure: Branch → Grow → Split → Prune**

### Node lifecycle:
1. **Created** from a thread or cluster of messages
2. **Expanded** via related chats, document edits, or knowledge merges
3. **Split** if it gets too large or diverges into multiple ideas
4. **Pruned** if inactive, outdated, or overridden

Use:
- `lastTouched`
- `connections`
- `size`
- `updateFreq`

To drive auto-suggestions:
> _“This node has grown large. Want to split it into 3?”_

> _“This node hasn't been touched in 3 weeks — archive it?”_

✅ You now have an **autonomous KB gardener** that helps you keep things tidy.

---

## 🔹 3. **Layered Context Building**
You want to avoid “send everything to GPT every time.”

### A layered approach:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Layer 0** | Most recent chat messages (5–10) |
| **Layer 1** | The active doc or doc section |
| **Layer 2** | Top-K relevant knowledge nodes (via vector search or tag match) |
| **Layer 3** | “Context bundles” — pre-computed summaries of relevant nodes for common intents (e.g. “product goal”) |
| **Layer 4** | “Dead-end blockers” — negative memory: “We tried X, it didn’t work because Y” |

### Combine with:
- **Static indexes** (per doc, per node)
- **Graph traversal** (walk the thinking tree via tags and edges)
- **Diff-aware updates** (to avoid full reanalysis)

✅ Only query GPT when something *new* is happening. Otherwise, lean on your local structure.

---

## 🔹 4. **Knowledge Base = Semantic Graph**

Every:
- Thread
- Document
- Idea
- Summary
- User question
- Decision

...is a **node** with:
- text
- metadata
- links
- tags

And your AI walks this graph to:
- Pull context
- Summarize it
- Connect new ideas
- Suggest edits

This is **Roam/Obsidian, with brains and self-awareness**.

# ⚙️ Part 3: Concrete Features You Could Build

Let’s make it real:

---

### ✅ Feature 1: **“Promote to Knowledge Node”**

At the end of a thread:
> _“Would you like to create a Knowledge Node summarizing this?”_

→ GPT generates: `title`, `summary`, `related ideas`, `status` (open, dead-end, decision)

---

### ✅ Feature 2: **Node Tree Sidebar**
- View all nodes in a tree
- Sort by last edited / most connected / status
- Click to explore, edit, link
- One-click “Open new thread from this node”

---

### ✅ Feature 3: **Context Composer**

Every GPT call:
- Assembles context via:
  - Last chat
  - Active doc chunk
  - Top 5 nodes by similarity
  - “Do not try” node if relevant

Optional: show the user the "thinking stack" before submission.

---

### ✅ Feature 4: **Node Evolution Engine (background process)**

Every N minutes:
- GPT revisits active nodes
- Merges similar ones
- Suggests splits
- Updates summaries
- Tracks decay (low similarity to current project)

Outputs:
> _“3 nodes updated. 1 merged. 1 split suggestion. Review changes?”_

✅ Memory evolves without micromanagement.

---

### ✅ Feature 5: **Auto-thread from list of ideas**
When GPT gives 5 ideas:
> _“Open threads to explore these?”_

Creates 5 pending tabs — you choose which to follow.

# ✨ Final Thought

You’re not building “memory” — you’re building **an AI-native thinking space** where ideas evolve, branch, and mature.

**The real magic**:  
You're giving AI a *structure* for *long-term reasoning*.
