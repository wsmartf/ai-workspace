## 🧠 1. **How Should the Knowledge Base Evolve?**

To feel intelligent (and useful), it needs to:

### ✅ Be **fed continuously**
- From chats (summaries, insights, questions)
- From document edits
- From decisions made (e.g. via “summarize this conclusion”)

### ✅ Be **organized adaptively**
- Grouped by topic, idea, subproject
- Possibly branching (forking when ideas diverge)

### ✅ Be **refined over time**
- Summaries improve
- Outdated assumptions are pruned or marked as such
- Redundant or overlapping notes are merged

### ✅ Respond to user behavior
- Notes you return to = more important
- Threads you forget = de-prioritized

---

### 🔁 Potential Evolution Triggers

| Trigger | Result |
|--------|--------|
| End of thread | AI suggests memory summary for new node |
| Large doc edit | AI diffs changes → updates relevant memory |
| Long chat session | AI suggests new “idea note” based on topic |
| Branching | Memory forked or split (child nodes created) |
| Manual edit | AI updates related nodes for consistency |
| Periodic background task | AI merges/re-tags/refines knowledge |

You can control this with lightweight logic to start (not full automation), but **design with these eventual flows in mind.**

## 🧱 2. **How Could the Knowledge Base Be Structured?**

This is where your system *really* diverges from linear chat tools.

A few long-term strategies you could combine:

---

### 📁 A. **Hierarchical File Structure** (like Obsidian)

```
/project-name
├── main.md
├── docs/
│   └── planning.md
├── ideas/
│   ├── threading/
│   │   ├── summary.md
│   │   └── tradeoffs.md
│   └── memory/
│       └── open-questions.md
```

Pros:
- Simple
- User-controlled
- Easy for LLMs to reason about when included as context

---

### 🔗 B. **Tagged + Linked Nodes** (like a light knowledge graph)

Each “idea” or “chunk”:
- Has a title, summary, and tags (e.g. `threading`, `tradeoffs`, `goals`)
- Links to related notes (backlinks)
- References threads or documents

Example structure (stored as JSON or frontmatter in markdown):

```json
{
  "id": "mem_013",
  "title": "Tradeoffs of Threading",
  "summary": "Branching allows structured exploration but introduces fragmentation risks.",
  "tags": ["threading", "architecture"],
  "linked_to": ["mem_014", "doc:planning.md"],
  "source": "thread:abc123"
}
```

Pros:
- Enables relevance lookup
- Easy to cluster or traverse
- Good for graph-based UIs

---

### 🌿 C. **Memory Tree**

Not all knowledge is equal — some nodes *lead to* others.

Imagine:
- A root node like “Product Vision”
- With child nodes: “Design Goals”, “Challenges”, “Open Questions”
- Each of those has its own notes, links, etc.

This mirrors your **thinking tree**, and lets users zoom in/out from abstract to concrete.

Could be implemented as:
- JSON tree structure
- File hierarchy + metadata
- Visual UI over linked nodes

---

## ⚙️ 3. **How to Use the KB to Build Context Dynamically**

This is where it gets *magic*. How do we use this evolving knowledge base to:

- Answer questions quickly
- Edit documents meaningfully
- Pull in just the right context

### ✅ Near-Term: Simple Filtering + Tagging

When building context, you can:
- Filter by tag (e.g. `["threading", "design-goal"]`)
- Include nodes linked to current doc/thread
- Limit to 5–10 relevant nodes (sorted by recency + relevance)

### ✅ Next: Vector search over summaries
- Index summaries of all memory nodes
- At runtime, embed the user query or doc edit intent
- Select the top 5–10 relevant notes
- Combine these with recent chat + doc excerpt as context

→ Fast, cheap, smart

You can even cache vector results for similar requests.

### ✅ Later: Semantic Graph Traversal

- Use LLMs to “walk the knowledge graph”
- e.g. “What ideas are relevant to doc section X?”
- Combine graph walking + similarity + tags
- Build “context bundles” based on where you are in the doc

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Use Static Indexes to Avoid Unnecessary LLM Calls

A practical trick:

- Periodically (or after major changes), precompile a “context index” for each doc/thread:
```json
{
  "doc:planning.md": ["mem_003", "mem_005", "mem_009"],
  "thread:xyz": ["mem_001", "mem_004"]
}
```

When building context for a task, start from that index rather than doing full similarity search every time.

✅ Cheap, fast, and works well for medium-scale projects.

## 💡 Summary

To make your knowledge base powerful:

### Structure:
- Use a hybrid of file tree + metadata + backlinks
- Let it grow in branches, not blobs
- Track tags, links, and sources

### Evolution:
- Summarize threads into idea nodes
- Suggest pruning/merging outdated knowledge
- Link to threads/docs automatically

### Context:
- Build with filtering + tagging first
- Add vector search for smart relevance
- Use precompiled indexes for speed

Would you like to start with a small `idea.json` node format + simple UI for saving summaries to that structure? Or prototype a dynamic context builder that pulls from a set of structured memory entries?
