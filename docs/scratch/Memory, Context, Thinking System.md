This is a **fantastic batch of raw thoughts**, and you're circling something really powerful here. Let's now start **carving out structure** from it — both conceptually and practically.

---

## 🔁 First: Memory ≠ Context

You asked a **key question**:

> Is it “memory” or just context? Do we even want to frame it as memory?

Short answer:
### ✅ “Memory” is long-term, user-visible  
### ✅ “Context” is short-term, ephemeral

**Memory** is the persistent knowledge base of your workspace.  
**Context** is what you pass into a model for a specific operation.

**Framing matters**:
- “Memory” feels high-stakes and opaque (“what did it save??”).
- “Project knowledge” or “Idea notes” feels *collaborative*, visible, and usable.

💡 Maybe don’t call it *Memory*. Call it something like:
- **Knowledge**
- **Project Notes**
- **Idea Map**
- **Workspace Intelligence**
- **Concept Log**

---

## 🧱 Second: Design the Storage Model

You're hinting at a **graph/tree model**, which is a great instinct. Here's a version of that idea, distilled:

### Project Structure:
```
project/
├── docs/
│   ├── main.md
│   ├── scratch.md
│   └── goals.md
├── ideas/
│   ├── idea-1/
│   │   ├── summary.md
│   │   └── brainstorm.md
│   └── idea-2/
│       ├── summary.md
│       └── tradeoffs.md
├── memory.json      ← structured memory entries
├── index.json       ← project metadata / structure
└── threads/         ← saved chat threads
```

### Memory is:
- Referencing specific files/sections
- Or representing AI-generated “knowledge chunks”
- Structured as:
```ts
{
  id: "mem_123",
  title: "Tradeoffs of Threading",
  content: "Branching allows structured alternatives, but can lead to fragmentation...",
  source: "idea-2/tradeoffs.md",
  tags: ["tradeoffs", "architecture"],
  related_to: ["idea-2"]
}
```

So now your **memory is a layer on top of docs** — part summary, part index, part insight.

## 💬 Third: How Do You *Build Context* for a Request?

You mentioned this flow, which is right on:

### 🔄 GPT Call Flow
1. **Select context** (memory nodes, doc sections, thread messages)
2. **Build prompt**: “Here’s what you should know…”
3. **Send the actual query**

💡 Break this into two layers:
- `getContextFor(requestType: 'chat' | 'edit' | 'summary') → context`
- `applyContext(context, prompt) → modelCall`

✅ This also allows you to test/debug context separately.

---

## 📐 How Much Context?

You asked:

> How big of a context should I use? What’s the sweet spot?

### GPT-4o context limit: 128K tokens  
**Safe window**: ~90K for input to allow for a full response.

### Rule of thumb:
- Document content: up to 10K–20K tokens
- Messages: last 5–10 turns (~2K–4K)
- Memory: up to 10 chunks, ~4K

You’ll need a **context-building strategy**:
- Prioritize memory relevance (via similarity search or tags)
- Prune low-signal parts of docs
- Summarize long threads before inclusion

---

## 🧠 Should You Use Vector Search?

✅ Eventually, yes.

For now, you can just use:
- Keywords/tags for filtering
- Recency (last 3 memory entries)
- Manual selection

Later:
- Use a library like [`@dqbd/tiktoken`](https://github.com/dqbd/tiktoken) to tokenize and chunk memory/doc
- Use [`chromadb`](https://www.trychroma.com/) or `faiss` locally to search

## 🧭 Fourth: Designing the *Thinking System*

This is where you get opinionated — and it’s your **superpower**.

> “This product bakes in real strategies for product thinking, writing, planning, etc.”

So what are some examples?

| Problem | Opinionated Strategy |
|--------|----------------------|
| Brainstorming ideas | Always start a new thread; summarize at the end |
| Evolving a plan | Use a scratch doc, and promote parts into `main.md` |
| Prioritization | Run a template prompt: “Compare tradeoffs across options” |
| Capturing key ideas | Don’t save messages manually — use `Summarize thread to idea note` |
| Organizing thoughts | Encourage tree structure: Ideas → summaries → sub-ideas |

You’re not just offering tools — you're embedding thought workflows.

## 🛠 What To Build Next (Practical Steps)

1. **Refactor “memory” to be “project knowledge”**
   - Store structured entries like `memory.json` or as markdown files
   - Let GPT help create these from chat summaries or doc diffs

2. **Add a “Summarize → Save to Idea” workflow**
   - UI: select part of a chat, click “Summarize to Idea”
   - Pick/create a target file (`ideas/threading/summary.md`)
   - Let AI generate + insert

3. **Build a context builder module**
   - Given a `requestType`, assemble context: memory + doc + messages
   - Show user a preview of what context will be used (optional)

4. **Start designing a knowledge sidebar**
   - Show project structure: ideas, docs, summaries
   - Let user browse, rename, drag ideas around (eventually)

---

## 🧠 Summary: You’re Building a Thinking OS

What memory is becoming in your tool:
- Not a log
- Not a model-side blob
- But a **structured, transparent, evolving index of ideas and understanding**.

It’s the **infrastructure of long-term thought**.
