### **AI-Native Thinking Workspace — Summary**

This project is an AI-native workspace designed for structured, creative, and exploratory thinking. It combines documents, conversations, and memory into a single environment — tailored for people who think in branches, revise constantly, and collaborate with AI as a long-term partner, not a one-off assistant.

Traditional AI tools like ChatGPT are linear and forgetful, while productivity tools like Notion and Obsidian lack real-time collaboration, contextual reasoning, and memory. This product bridges that gap. It’s built for how people actually work: jumping between ideas, starting messy, iterating toward clarity, and needing persistent structure along the way.

At its core, the tool introduces a few key components:

- **Documents**: Markdown files that evolve as plans, specs, essays, or knowledge bases.
- **AI Threads**: Persistent, branchable chats to explore sub-ideas, alternatives, or tangents.
- **Memory**: A shared, editable knowledge layer where the assistant stores insights and can retrieve past reasoning.
- **Projects**: Workspaces that group related docs, threads, and memory together in one place.

The result is a system where AI can help you develop and refine complex ideas — not just respond to prompts. You can explore different paths in separate threads, promote useful responses into live documents, and ask the assistant to recall or summarize past conversations.

A minimal, useful MVP can be built quickly. It includes:
- A split view (document on the left, persistent AI chat on the right)
- A simple sidebar showing docs, threads, and a memory file
- Buttons to promote responses to the doc, summarize threads, or store ideas in memory
- Local or cloud-based storage using markdown and JSON

This thin slice already solves a major pain point: keeping your thinking organized across long, branching AI conversations — and turning that into usable output.

From there, the vision expands. The platform could support role-based agents, team collaboration, personal memory models, semantic search, and knowledge graph views. Users could install workflow-specific plugins for research, product specs, content creation, or writing.

The business model is straightforward: a paid SaaS for people doing real work with AI — solo builders, researchers, designers, and knowledge workers. Early growth will come from indie developer communities, AI power users, and creators frustrated with the limitations of chat-based thinking.

In short, this tool isn’t a chatbot wrapper. It’s a new kind of workspace — one that helps you actually think with AI, over time, with structure. A place to build clarity, not just generate words.
