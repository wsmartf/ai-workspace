# üß† Knowledge Node System ‚Äì MVP Design Overview

### Core Concept:
A **Knowledge Node** is a persistent unit of structured insight created from a thread, document, or direct user action. It represents a single idea, decision, insight, or topic ‚Äî with links to where it came from and what it's connected to.

---

### 1. Core Features

- **Create Node from Thread**
  - Manual trigger (e.g. ‚ÄúPromote to Node‚Äù)
  - Optional system suggestion at end of thread
  - Uses LLM to generate: title, summary, tags, links, metadata

- **Node Storage**
  - Simple JSON-based format for MVP
  - Flat list of nodes, stored in `nodes/` or `project.json`
  - Each node contains: title, summary, tags, references, createdAt, updatedAt, origin (thread or doc)

- **Node Viewer**
  - Sidebar tab or modal
  - Browse existing nodes
  - View details
  - Possibly: search or filter by tag (MVP optional)

- **Doc Generation from Nodes**
  - User selects 1+ nodes
  - Click ‚ÄúGenerate Doc‚Äù
  - Sends to LLM with prompt to synthesize content
  - Output can be inserted into the main doc or as a new document

- **Node Updates from Docs (Optional MVP)**
  - When document changes, prompt LLM to update related nodes
  - Possibly via diff or summarization

---

### 2. Node Data Structure (MVP Schema)

```ts
{
  id: string, // UUID
  title: string,
  summary: string, // core idea, 2-6 sentences
  tags: string[],
  sources: {
    type: "thread" | "doc",
    id: string
  }[],
  related: string[], // node IDs
  createdAt: ISOString,
  updatedAt: ISOString,
}
```

---

### 3. UI Integration

- **Threads View**
  - Button: ‚ÄúPromote to Node‚Äù
  - (Optional) Inline suggestion if thread is long enough or has distinct conclusion

- **Node Sidebar**
  - List of nodes
  - Click to expand full node
  - Show tags, summary, metadata
  - Maybe a ‚Äú+ New‚Äù button for manual node creation

- **Document View**
  - Button: ‚ÄúInsert from Nodes‚Äù
  - User selects 1‚ÄìN nodes
  - LLM generates synthesized text
  - Insert into doc (append or replace)

---

### 4. Future-Proofing

Not MVP, but planned:
- Vector embeddings + similarity search
- Semantic relationships (auto-linking nodes)
- Background summarization / pruning
- Visual graph of nodes
- Node versioning + changelog
- Node-to-thread linking (auto start new thread from node)

---

### 5. Files + Structure (Proposal)

```
/project
  /nodes
    node-001.json
    node-002.json
  document.md
  threads.json
  memory.json
```

Or, if you're using JSON flat storage:

```json
nodes: [
  {
    id: "node-001",
    ...
  }
]
```

---

### Next Step Options:

1. Flesh out the Node creation flow (LLM prompt + UI + file save)
2. Build a basic Node viewer in a sidebar
3. Add ‚ÄúInsert from Nodes‚Äù to document editor

Which one do you want to spec out in detail next?
