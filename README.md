An experimental tool for structured, creative, and exploratory thinking ‚Äî designed to integrate documents, conversations, and memory into a single seamless environment.

Traditional AI tools like ChatGPT are powerful but forgetful. Productivity tools like Notion or Obsidian are flexible but lack context awareness and real-time reasoning. This workspace bridges that gap.

## Core Concepts

At its heart, the system introduces four core components:

- **üìÑ Documents** ‚Äî Evolving markdown files for writing, planning, specs, or notes.
- **üí¨ AI Threads** ‚Äî Persistent, branchable chat conversations for exploring sub-ideas, alternatives, or rabbit holes.
- **üß† Memory** ‚Äî A shared, editable knowledge layer that AI can recall, update, and use for context-aware reasoning.
- **üìÅ Projects** ‚Äî Logical workspaces that organize docs, threads, and memory around a central idea.

This architecture enables a workflow where you can:
- Jump between ideas like branches
- Promote useful AI responses into live documents
- Summon past conversations and insights into context
- Work with AI as a long-term thinking partner
